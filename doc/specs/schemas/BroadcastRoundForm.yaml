              Filter games by round number

              Optional, only keep games from the source that match a round number.
              It uses the PGN **Round** tag. These would match round 3:
              ```txt
              [Round "3"]
              [Round "3.1"]
              ```
              If you set a round number, then games without a **Round** tag are dropped.

              It only works if you chose `syncUrl` or `syncUrls` as the source.

              Select slices of the games

              Optional. Select games based on their position in the source.
              ```txt
              1           only select the first board
              1-4         only select the first 4 boards

              Slicing is done after filtering by round number.
