      `cursed-win` and `blessed-loss` means the 50-move rule prevents
      the decisive result.

      `syzygy-win` and `syzygy-loss` means exact result is unknown due to
      [DTZ rounding](https://syzygy-tables.info/metrics#dtz), i.e., the
      win or loss could also be prevented by the 50-move rule if
      the user has deviated from the tablebase recommendation since the
      last pawn move or capture.

      `maybe-win` and `maybe-loss` means the result with regard to the
      50-move rule is unknown, because DTZ is unknown and the DTC tablebase
      does not guarantee to reach a zeroing move as soon as possible.
