  summary: Manually schedule the next round
  description: |
    Manually schedule the next round date and time of a Swiss tournament.
    This sets the `roundInterval` field to `99999999`, i.e. manual scheduling.
    All further rounds will need to be manually scheduled, unless the `roundInterval` field is changed back to automatic scheduling.
