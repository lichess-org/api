  summary: Stream games by IDs
  description: |
    Creates a stream of games from an arbitrary streamId, and a list of game IDs.
    The stream first outputs the games that already exists, then emits an event each time a game is started or finished.
    Games are streamed as [ndjson](#description/streaming-with-nd-json).
    Maximum number of games: 500 for anonymous requests, or 1000 for [OAuth2 authenticated](#description/authentication) requests.
    While the stream is open, it is possible to [add new game IDs to watch](#tag/games/POST/api/stream/games/{streamId}/add).
