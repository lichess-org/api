  summary: Stream moves of a game
  description: |
    Stream positions and moves of any ongoing game, in [ndjson](#description/streaming-with-nd-json).
    A description of the game is sent as a first message.
    Then a message is sent each time a move is played.
    Finally, a description of the game is sent when it finishes, and the stream is closed.
    Ongoing games are delayed by a few seconds ranging from 3 to 60 depending on the time control, as to prevent cheat bots from using this API.
    No more than 8 game streams can be opened at the same time from the same IP address.
