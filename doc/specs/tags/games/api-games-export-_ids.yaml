  summary: Export games by IDs
  description: |
    Download games by IDs in PGN or [ndjson](#description/streaming-with-nd-json) format, depending on the request `Accept` header.
    Games are sorted by reverse chronological order (most recent first)
    The method is `POST` so a longer list of IDs can be sent in the request body.
    300 IDs can be submitted.
    Ongoing games are delayed by 3 moves, as to prevent cheat bots from using this API.
  tags:
    - Games
  security: []
  requestBody:
    description: Game IDs separated by commas. Up to 300.
