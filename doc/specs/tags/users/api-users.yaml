    Get up to 300 users by their IDs. Users are returned in the same order as the IDs.
    The method is `POST` to allow a longer list of IDs to be sent in the request body.
    Please do not try to download all the Lichess users with this endpoint, or any other endpoint.
    An API is not a way to fully export a website. We do not provide a full download of the Lichess users.
    This endpoint is limited to 8,000 users every 10 minutes, and 120,000 every day.
