  summary: Get real-time users status

    Read the `online`, `playing` and `streaming` flags of several users.
    This API is very fast and cheap on lichess side.
    So you can call it quite often (like once every 5 seconds).
    Use it to track players and know when they're connected on lichess and playing games.
