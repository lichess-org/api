    Games of a Lichess player.

    Responds with a stream of [newline delimited JSON](#section/Introduction/Streaming-with-ND-JSON). Will start indexing
    on demand, immediately respond with the current results, and stream
    more updates until indexing is complete. The stream is throttled
    and deduplicated. Empty lines may be sent to avoid timeouts.

    Will index new games at most once per minute, and revisit previously
    ongoing games at most once every day.
