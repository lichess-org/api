  summary: Export one round as PGN
  description: |
    Download all games of a single round of a broadcast tournament in PGN format.
    You *could* poll this endpoint to get updates about a tournament, but it would be slow,
    and very inefficient.
    Instead, consider [streaming the tournament](#tag/broadcasts/GET/api/stream/broadcast/round/{broadcastRoundId}.pgn) to get
    a new PGN every time a game is updated, in real-time.
