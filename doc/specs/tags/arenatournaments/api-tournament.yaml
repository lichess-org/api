    A team battle can be created by specifying the `teamBattleByTeam` argument.
    Additional restrictions:
      - clockTime + clockIncrement > 0
      - 15s and 0+1 variant tournaments cannot be rated
      - Clock time in comparison to tournament length must be reasonable: 3 <= (minutes * 60) / (96 * clockTime + 48 * clockIncrement + 15) <= 150
