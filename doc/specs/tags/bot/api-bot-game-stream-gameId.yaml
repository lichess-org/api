  summary: Stream Bot game state
  description: "\
  \ Stream the state of a game being played with the Bot API, as [ndjson](#section/Introduction/Streaming-with-ND-JSON).\n\
  \nUse this endpoint to get updates about the game in real-time, with a single request.\n\
  \nEach line is a JSON object containing a `type` field. Possible values are:\n
  \ - `gameFull` Full game data. All values are immutable, except for the `state` field.\n
  \ - `gameState` Current state of the game. Immutable values not included.\n
  \ - `chatLine` Chat message sent by a user (or the bot itself) in the `room` \"player\" or \"spectator\".\n\n
  \ - `opponentGone` Whether the opponent has left the game, and how long before you can claim a win or draw.\n\n
  \nThe first line is always of type `gameFull`."
