    **Endpoint: `https://engine.lichess.ovh/api/external-engine/{id}/analyse`**
    Request analysis from an external engine.
    Response content is streamed as [newline delimited JSON](#section/Introduction/Streaming-with-ND-JSON).
    The properties are based on the [UCI specification](https://backscattering.de/chess/uci/#engine).
    Analysis stops when the client goes away, the requested limit
    is reached, or the provider goes away.
