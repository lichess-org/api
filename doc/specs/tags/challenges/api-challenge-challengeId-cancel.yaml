  summary: Cancel a challenge
  description: |
    Cancel a challenge you sent, or aborts the game if the challenge was accepted, but the game was not yet played.
    Note that the ID of a game is the same as the ID of the challenge that created it.
    Works for user challenges and open challenges alike.
