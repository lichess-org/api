  summary: Open-ended challenge
  description: |
    Create a challenge that any 2 players can join.
    Share the URL of the challenge. the first 2 players to click it will be paired for a game.
    The response body also contains `whiteUrl` and `blackUrl`.
    You can control which color each player gets by giving them these URLs,
    instead of the main challenge URL.
    Open challenges expire after 24h.
    If the challenge creation is [authenticated with OAuth2](#section/Introduction/Authentication),
    then you can use the [challenge cancel endpoint](#operation/challengeCancel) to cancel it.
    To directly pair 2 known players, use [this endpoint](#operation/bulkPairingList) instead.
