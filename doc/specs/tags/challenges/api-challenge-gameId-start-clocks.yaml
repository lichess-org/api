  operationId: challengeStartClocks
  summary: Start clocks of a game
  description: |
    Start the clocks of a game immediately, even if a player has not yet made a move.
    Requires the OAuth tokens of both players with `challenge:write` scope.
    If the clocks have already started, the call will have no effect.

    For AI games with only one player, omit the `token2` parameter.
