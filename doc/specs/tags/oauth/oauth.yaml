    OAuth2 authorization endpoint.
    Start the OAuth2 Authorization Code Flow with PKCE by securely
    generating two random strings unique to each authorization
    request:

    * `code_verifier`
    * `state`

    Store these in session storage. Make sure not to reveal `code_verifier`
    to eavesdroppers. Do not show it in URLs, do not abuse `state` to store
    it, do not send it over insecure connections. However it is fine if
    the user themselves can extract `code_verifier`, which will always be
    possible for fully client-side apps.
    Then send the user to this endpoint. They will be prompted to grant
    authorization and then be redirected back to the given `redirect_uri`.
    If the authorization failed, the following query string parameters will
    be appended to the redirection:

    * `error`, in particular with value `access_denied` if the user
       cancelled authorization
    * `error_description` to aid debugging
    * `state`, exactly as passed in the `state` parameter

    If the authorization succeeded, the following query string parameters
    will be appended to the redirection:

    * `code`, containing a fresh short-lived authorization code
    * `state`, exactly as passed in the `state` parameter

    Next, to defend against cross site request forgery, check that the
    returned `state` matches the `state` you originally generated.

    Finally, continue by using the authorization code to
    [obtain an access token](#tag/oauth/POST/api/token).
