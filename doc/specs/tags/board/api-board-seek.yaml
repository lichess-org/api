  summary: Create a seek
  description: |
    Create a public seek, to start a game with a random player.

    ### Real-time seek

    Specify the `time` and `increment` clock values.
    The response is streamed but doesn't contain any information.

    **Keep the connection open to keep the seek active**.

    If the client closes the connection, the seek is canceled. This way, if the client terminates, the user won't be paired in a game they wouldn't play.
    When the seek is accepted, or expires, the server closes the connection.

    **Make sure to also have an [Event stream](#operation/apiStreamEvent) open**, to be notified when a game starts.
    We recommend opening the [Event stream](#operation/apiStreamEvent) first, then the seek stream. This way,
    you won't miss the game event if the seek is accepted immediately.

    ### Correspondence seek

    Specify the `days` per turn value.
    The response is not streamed, it immediately completes with the seek ID. The seek remains active on the server until it is joined by someone.
