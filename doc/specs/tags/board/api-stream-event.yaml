    Stream the events reaching a lichess user in real time as [ndjson](#section/Introduction/Streaming-with-ND-JSON).

    An empty line is sent every 6 seconds for keep alive purposes.

    Each non-empty line is a JSON object containing a `type` field. Possible values are:
    - `gameStart` Start of a game
    - `gameFinish` Completion of a game
    - `challenge` A player sends you a challenge or you challenge someone
    - `challengeCancelled` A player cancels their challenge to you
    - `challengeDeclined` The opponent declines your challenge

    When the stream opens, all current challenges and games are sent.
