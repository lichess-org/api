  summary: Stream Board game state
  description: "\
  \ Stream the state of a game being played with the Board API, as [ndjson](#section/Introduction/Streaming-with-ND-JSON).\n\
  \nUse this endpoint to get updates about the game in real-time, with a single request.\n\
  \nEach line is a JSON object containing a `type` field. Possible values are:\n
  \ - `gameFull` Full game data. All values are immutable, except for the `state` field.\n
  \ - `gameState` Current state of the game. Immutable values not included. Sent when a move is played, a draw is offered, or when the game ends.\n
  \ - `chatLine` Chat message sent by a user in the `room` \"player\" or \"spectator\".\n\n
  \ - `opponentGone` Whether the opponent has left the game, and how long before you can claim a win or draw.\n\n
  \nThe first line is always of type `gameFull`.\n\n
  \nThe server closes the stream when the game ends, or if the game has already ended."
