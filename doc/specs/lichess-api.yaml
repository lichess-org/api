        The account **cannot have played any game** before becoming a Bot account. The upgrade is **irreversible**. The account will only be able to play as a Bot.

        To upgrade an account to Bot, use the [official lichess-bot client](https://github.com/careless25/lichess-bot), or follow these steps:
        - Create an [API access token](https://lichess.org/account/oauth/token/create?scopes[]=bot:play) with "Play bot moves" permission.
        - `curl -d '' https://lichess.org/api/bot/account/upgrade -H "Authorization: Bearer <yourTokenHere>"`

        To know if an account has already been upgraded, use the [Get my profile API](#operation/accountMe):
        the `title` field should be set to `BOT`.

        Challenge someone to play. The targeted player can choose to accept or decline.

        If the challenge is accepted, you will be notified on the [event stream](#operation/apiStreamEvent)
        that a new game has started. The game ID will be the same as the challenge ID.

        If you also have an OAuth token with `challenge:write` scope for the receiving user,
        you can make them accept the challenge immediately by setting the `acceptByToken` field.

        Schedule many games at once, up to 24h in advance.

        OAuth tokens are required for all paired players, with the `challenge:write` scope.

        You can schedule up to 500 games every 10 minutes. [Contact us](mailto:contact@lichess.org) if you need higher limits.

        The entire bulk is rejected if:
          - a token is missing
          - a token is present more than once
          - a token lacks the `challenge:write` scope
          - a player account is closed
          - a player is paired more than once
          - a bulk is already scheduled to start at the same time with the same player
          - you have 10 scheduled bulks
          - you have 1000 scheduled games

        Partial bulks are never created. Either it all fails, or it all succeeds.
        When it fails, it does so with an error message explaining the issue.
        Failed bulks are not counted in the rate limiting, they are free.
        Fix the issues, manually or programmatically, then retry to schedule the bulk.

        A successful bulk creation returns a JSON bulk document. Its ID can be used for further operations.

                    The 2 tokens of the players of a game are separated with `:`. The first token gets the white pieces. Games are separated with `,`.

                    Up to 1000 tokens can be sent, for a max of 500 games.

                    Each token must be included at most once.

        This overrides the `startClocksAt` value of an existing bulk pairing.

        If the games have not yet been created (`bulk.pairAt` is in the future), then this does nothing.

        If the clocks have already started (`bulk.startClocksAt` is in the past), then this does nothing.
